# ðŸš€ Daily Codewars Challenges
This repository is where I save my daily coding challenge solutions from [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/danjkim21). <br>

I am trying my best to get daily repetition in to keep core concepts fresh in my head. I've committed to pushing at least 5 solutions every week. Every morning, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar! <br>

There is an endless supply of questions, and an even longer list of potential solutions to each question. I have a long way to go but I plan to take the initiative to consistently improve and learn from each challenge I complete (or don't complete).<br>
