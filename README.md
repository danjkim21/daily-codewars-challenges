# daily-codewars-challenges

This repository is where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions from Codewars.com. <br>
I am trying my best to get daily repetition in to keep core concepts fresh in my head, hopefully doing this out in public will help keep me accountable. I've committed to pushing at least 5 solutions every week. Every morning, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar! <br>
There is an endless supply of questions, and an even longer list of potential solutions to each question. I have a long way to go but I plan to take the initiative to consistently improve and learn from each challenge I complete (or don't complete).
